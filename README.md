# Quill Spellcheck Demo

Spellcheck in a WYSIWYG Editor. I have modified the Tooltip provided by [Quill](https://quilljs.com/) to suggest words.

### [Click for a demo](https://zaffnet.github.io/quill_spellcheck_demo/)

## Dependencies
* [quill.js](https://quilljs.com/) - WYSIWYG Text Editor
* [fuzzyset.js](https://glench.github.io/fuzzyset.js/) - A fuzzy string matching algorithm to determine likely misspellings and approximate string matching

## Notes
1.  The dictionary is located at `js/words.js`. It can be downloaded from [here](http://www.gwicks.net/dictionaries.htm).
2.  The code is not tested thoroughly for edge cases.

PRs welcome :blush:
